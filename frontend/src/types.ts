/**
 * =============================================================================
 * TYPES.TS - TYPE DEFINITIONS FOR THE ENTIRE APPLICATION
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * BEGINNER EXPLANATION:
 * Think of this file as a "dictionary" or "blueprint" for our data.
 * In TypeScript, we use "interfaces" to define what properties an object should have.
 * This helps catch errors before they happen!
 * 
 * Example: If we define a Pet must have a "name", TypeScript will yell at us
 * if we try to create a Pet without a name.
 * 
 * The "?" symbol means: "this property is optional (can be missing)"
 * Example: microchipId? means a pet might or might not have a microchip
 * =============================================================================
