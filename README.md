## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20 LTS
- npm 10+
- Netlify CLI (optional for local development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd petcare-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use the automated fix script (recommended if you encounter npm errors)
   ./fix-dependencies.sh
   
   # Option 2: Standard installation
   npm run install:all
   # This installs dependencies for frontend and serverless functions
   ```
   
   > **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter `ENOTEMPTY` or other npm errors, run `fix-dependencies.sh` to resolve them. See [DEPENDENCY_FIX.md](./DEPENDENCY_FIX.md) for details.

3. **Configure environment variables**

   This project uses multiple environment scopes:

- Root (`.env`) — variables used by serverless functions and tools (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.)
- Netlify functions (`netlify/functions/.env`) — variables available to serverless functions at runtime when running locally with Netlify Dev
- Frontend (`frontend/.env`) — client-side config for Vite (VITE_* variables)

   Example files are provided. Copy the appropriate example to create your local `.env` files and DO NOT commit them.

   ```bash
   # Root env (server / functions)
   cp .env.example .env

   # Functions-specific env (local dev)
   cp netlify/functions/.env.example netlify/functions/.env || true

   # Frontend env (client-side Vite variables)
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env || true
   ```

Notes:
- Never commit `.env` files. They are gitignored by default.
- `frontend/.env` values starting with `VITE_` are safe to expose in client bundles if they contain non-sensitive values.
- If you add a new environment variable to code, update the corresponding `.env.example` file immediately.

If you want to check that `.env` is ignored:

```bash
grep -E "^\.env(\b|\.|$)" .gitignore || true
```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Runs Netlify Dev via npx on http://localhost:8888 (functions available at /.netlify/functions/*)
   ```

Quick verification (after installing deps and copying env files):

```bash
# Check node/npm versions
node -v && npm -v

# Run Netlify Dev
npm run dev

# (Optional) In a separate terminal: run frontend only
npm --prefix frontend run dev

# (Optional) Typecheck or build functions
npm --prefix netlify/functions run typecheck || npm --prefix netlify/functions run build
```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8888`

### Demo Data (Development)

- On first load, the app seeds demo data (users, pets, appointments)
  into `localStorage` via an initializer in `frontend/src/utils/testData.ts`.
- This makes the app usable without a real database during development.
- In production, configure the serverless API with a PostgreSQL database.

### Deployment to Netlify

1. **Install Netlify CLI**
   ```bash
  npm install
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify**
   ```bash
  npx netlify login
   ```

3. **Initialize site**
   ```bash
  npx netlify init
   ```

4. **Deploy**
   ```bash
  npx netlify deploy --prod
    ```

## Getting Started

For complete installation and deployment instructions, see [docs/installation_and_deploy.md](./docs/installation_and_deploy.md).

Learn how to read the codebase comments in [docs/CODE_COMMENTS_GUIDE.md](./docs/CODE_COMMENTS_GUIDE.md).

## 🔑 Demo Credentials

These accounts are preloaded via demo data and can be used to explore each dashboard:

### Administrator
- **Elevated Admin:** `admin@petcare.com` / `password123`

### Veterinarian
- **Dr. Sarah Johnson:** `vet@petcare.com` / `password123`

### Pet Owner
- **John Smith:** `owner@petcare.com` / `password123`

**Note:** All demo accounts use the same password (`password123`) for simplicity. In production, enforce strong, unique passwords.
